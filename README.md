A great chef uses sharp knives‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut it‚Äôs not the knives that do the cooking.

- A company can invest in the latest productivity software. Roll it out with top-notch technical training. And yes, its employees will become whizzes‚Ä¶At using the software. They won‚Äôt become more productive.
- "Reduce" - Scheduling, says Cal Newport, the founder of Study Hacks ‚Äúforces you to confront the reality of how much time you actually have and how long things will take.‚Äù
- "Assess" - Think in blocks, not hours.
- "Eliminate" - In Essentialism, Greg McKeown summarizes: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about making the trade-off between lots of good things and a few really great things.‚Äù

# Tools that help you write clean code:
A look at Prettier, ESLint, Husky, Lint-Staged and EditorConfig

- Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It formats code for you in a specific way
- ESLint , Code Linter for JS.Everything in ESLint is pluggable.
- Husky basically let‚Äôs you Git hook. That means you can perform some certain actions when you are about to commit or when you are about to push code to a branch.
- Lint-staged helps you run linters on staged files, so that bad code doesn‚Äôt get pushed to your branch.
- .editorconfig. This actually helps enforce some certain rule sets in the editor of your choice.

# What is the MERN Stack - MongoDB, ExpressJS, Node.js, and ReactJS used to build production ready universal web apps.
 

- A variant of the MEAN stack with A being Angular 
- Is  MEVN (Vue.js) going to be the next stack?
- All four of these technologies are open source, cross-platform and JavaScript based
- Here is a powerful boilerplate project that gives you a solid head start on building universal React apps

Building a Node.js WebSocket App with Socket.io and React -

- WebSockets over HTTP for real-time comms
- the  socket.io npm package, which provides us with a node.js WebSocket API
- Socket.io providing a failover mechanism for WebSockets

# " The ‚ÄúA‚Äù in CAMS is the only vowel = automation is the most important "

The only way to achieve continuous delivery/DevOps is to follow the CAMS formula - Damon Edwards and John Willis

- The team respect the CULTURE by respecting each other
- The team AUTOMATE wherever possible to eliminate error
- The team MEASURE progress, and
- The team SHARE feedback freely without blame

# BFF ( Backend for Frontend) for microservices! 

- The Backend for Frontend design pattern, as described by Phil Cal√ßado, refers to the concept of developing niche backends for each user experience.
- APIs are crafted to connect easily to other services, both internal and external. While this certainly is beneficial from a user perspective, developers often find the result of this type of development to have some problematic elements.
- a BFF can be incredibly powerful when used as it is meant to be used ‚Äî a translative layer between disparate API services and experiences.

# istio
As containers have become the industry standard for cloud deployments they have brought a new element of complexity to developers who have to orchestrate and monitor a bunch of microservices. Solution = Google's latest open source release, Istio 

- Istio is an "open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices".
- Otherwise known as a 'service mesh', the aim is to unify traffic flow management, access policy enforcement and telemetry data aggregation across microservices into a shared management console, regardless of environment.
- My favorite you can better control traffic with dynamic route configuration and it is easier to conduct A/B tests and release canaries

# API mediation (in other words: API experience management) Or the API Experience Layer - 

- This layer wraps the backend API (the inner API) and exposes a personalized and managed API (the outer API) to each defined constituency of consumers, simplifying the developer experience while also ensuring loose coupling.

# PWD - "Play-With-Docker‚Äù Button on your Github project simplest way to spin up an env ! 

- For a period of 4 hours, you can pull, build, run and interact with as many Docker containers as you wish
- Under the hood Docker-in-Docker (DinD) is used to give the effect of multiple VMs/PCs.

# All software engineers can program, but not all programmers can engineer software ! 
hashtag#sensibledefaults hashtag#bestpractices hashtag#engineering101 

- If someone does not understand the problem, they should not be allowed to program a solution for it.

- ‚ÄúThere are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.‚Äù

- If you are a JavaScript developer and, for some reason, you are forced to pick only one plugin for your code editor, you should pick ESLint.

# Excellent End to End modern CI/CD pipeline to play with and once it's up and running, the fun of shipping functionality in short iterations and small increments! 

1. Create a Python Program 
2. Add -> Automated Unit tests in a VirtualEnv
3. Push the code to -> Github 
4. Add CI -> Travis CI to run tests at every commit 
5. Sensible Defaults check -> Better Code Hub for code quality at every push and PR
6. More sophisticated code -> Python program to a web app 
7. Containerize your web app-> Docker
8. Artifacts Mgmt ->  Deploy image to Docker Hub
9. Deploy on a cloud platform  ->  Heroku 
10. Enjoy shipping functionality in short iterations and small increments -> feature branches

# An interesting concept run by a bunch of ex-Googlers (from the startup world with Room 77 and when it was acquired, they worked for ranking algos and the search engine)

The Refdash Concept:
- Mocking interviews that could give candidates in-depth feedback and suggestions on what suits them best 
 - same goes for companies trying to hire the best talent.

 # love this concept of "read and implement one chapter per iteration"

One of the most important elements of a software engineer‚Äôs personal development is reading. In a field so vast, one of the ‚Äúmust read‚Äù books is Clean Code, by Robert C. Martin.

# The 12 Factor App
If you are involved with any kind of development work , the twelve-factor app is a must read - inspired by Martin Fowler‚Äôs books Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture and Refactoring.

# Do you have a "test efficacy" like google does ? Love this line - " running an additional test that you know will pass is not a valuable signal to developers and likely a waste of resources" 

- The ideal "Efficacy Presubmit" would predict which tests will pass ahead of time and only run tests which were going to fail.

- Given the abstraction on the presubmit testing process described above, predicting the outcomes of automated testing at a large company is a perfect machine learning problem in many ways

Good read for anyone involved in creating automated tests - https://lnkd.in/gJypgvM?

# Wow this is awesome - Netflix changing development IDE to notebooks.
Jupyter was amazing but this is taking it to the next level!

- Scaling Notebooks ? Papermill is the game changer , nteract library built for configurable and reliable execution of notebooks with production ecosystems in mind. 
- 10,000 scheduled jobs running on Netflix Data Platform execution on notebooks
- 150,000 genie jobs
- storing output frm notebooks to an s3 bucket managed by Commuter, another nteract project
-finally running them using Docker 

- Dig in more if you are a fan of Jupyter at scale or follow JupyterCon hashtag#Jupyter

One in our area of expertise, one in leadership role with a holistic view and finally one outside work or in a completely unrelated field.
